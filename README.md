## About The Curriculum

This repository is split into units for supporting students in creating an applications powered by artificial intelligence that has been developed using the Python programming language.

The approach of this curriculum was created using a backwards planning process, beginning with the goal of creating a web-based Computer Vision application. The process for creating a web-based application is grounded in created a Gradio application hosted on Hugging Face (huggingface.co) (Unit 03). In order to create such a web-based application, it is necessary that a .pkl model be created using deep learning techniques. The curriculum leverages the Fast.AI API to create such a model, and the jupyter notebooks necessary to accomplish this task are located in Unit 02. For learners to understand and work within the Fast.AI API, they must first be comfortable with the Python programming language, and so the first unit (Unit 01) is focused on developing the programming skills necessary to work with Python.

## The Process
1. Learners work with activities to develop competency with they Python programming language and jupyter notebooks.
1. Learners use Docker containers, jupyter notebooks, and the fastai librari to created a computer vision deep learning model.
1. Learners leverage the computer vision model they created to build a web-based Gradio application hosted on Hugging Face to deploy a tool that educates and disseminates cultural knowledge.

## Getting Started
1. Create a fork of this repository
1. Clone the fork of the repository associated to run locally (we suggest you use GitHub Desktop)
1. For each unit, follow the instructions in the associated Readme.md file to appropriately run the Jupyter Notebook environment 
Then follow the Readme.md for that unit
